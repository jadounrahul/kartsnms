## Reporting a Vulnerability

Like anyone, we appreciate the work people put in to find flaws in
software and welcome anyone to do so with KartsNMS, this will lead to
better quality and more secure software for everyone.

If you think you've found a vulnerability and want to discuss it with
some of the core team then you can contact us on
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kartsnms) and we will endeavour to
get back to as quick as we can, this is usually within 24 hours.

We are happy to attribute credit to the findings, but we ask that we're
given a chance to patch any vulnerability before public disclosure so
that our users can update as soon as a fix is available.
